Document Version Control System

Problem Statement
This project addresses the challenge of managing complex document version histories, especially in collaborative or research environments. 
Traditional linear version systems struggle with non-linear changes, branching, and reconstruction. This system models versions as a graph, 
allowing flexible navigation, annotation, and recovery of versions.

Data Structures Used
- Graph (Adjacency List): To represent document versions and their relationships.
- HashMap: For quick retrieval of versions, annotations, and relationships.
- ArrayList: To maintain collections of versions, annotations, and connections.

File Overview

Java Backend Files:
- HistoricalVersionControlSys.java: Main driver of the system.
- DocumentGraph.java: Core graph structure and traversal logic.
- Annotation.java: Stores metadata or notes per version.
- Manuscript.java: Wraps content and metadata.
- ReconstructionTheory.java: Contains logic to recover lost versions.
- Relationship.java: Models edges in the version graph.
- TextVersion.java: Represents a single document version.
- WebController.java: Connects backend to frontend using REST.

Frontend HTML Files:
- index.html: Main entry page with navigation.
- graphdetails.html: Displays version graph visually.
- theorydetails.html: Shows reconstruction logic and outcomes.
- versiondetails.html: Displays details of each document version.

Features
- Non-linear version tracking with graphsclass
- Annotation support
- Lost version reconstruction
- Clean HTML interface

Use Cases
- Historical document preservation
- Academic and research collaboration
- Manuscript revision tracking
